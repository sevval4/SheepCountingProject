Sheep Detection and Counting in Video using YOLO
This project aims to detect and count sheep in a given video using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model. The program processes the video frame by frame and counts the number of unique sheep that appear in a specified region of interest.

Project Overview
The project uses the following technologies and libraries:

OpenCV: For video processing and manipulation.
YOLOv5: A state-of-the-art object detection model for identifying objects in the frames.
NumPy: For handling numerical operations and region of interest calculations.
